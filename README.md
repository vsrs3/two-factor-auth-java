# Two-Factor Authentication in Java

This repository provides a Java implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA). The project is designed to help developers integrate an extra layer of security into their Java applications by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication in addition to their password.

## Features

- Written entirely in Java for easy integration with Java-based systems.
- Likely supports Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) or similar algorithms commonly used for 2FA.
- May include example code or sample UI for demonstration purposes (potentially the reason for CSS/HTML).
- Source code is organized within the `src/org` directory.

## Usage

Clone the repository and integrate the Java classes into your project. The core logic will be found under `src/org`.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vsrs3/two-factor-auth-java.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the source directory and review the code in `src/org`.

3. Follow any documentation or code comments to integrate 2FA into your own application.
